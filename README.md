**Repository:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bugfishtm/Android-Web-App-Example)  
**Documentation:** [Online Documentation](https://bugfishtm.github.io/Android-Web-App-Example/)

## Overview

The Android WebApp Example is a ready-to-use Android Studio project designed to create a simple web app with built-in controls at the bottom, including forward, back, and home buttons. You can easily customize this web app by modifying the main.java file to specify your desired URL and then compile it to generate a finished .apk file. This project simplifies the process of creating web apps related to your website. All you need is Android Studio installed on your system, and you can quickly make the necessary changes.

## Requirements for Compilation

This software is developed using Android Studio, and we recommend using this development environment to modify the source code and compile the project. You can simply import the source folder into Android Studio.

## Modifying the Source Code

To customize the web app for your specific needs, follow these steps:

1. Change the variable "theURL" to your website's URL. You can find this variable in the following file:
   "source\app\src\main\java\com\bugfish/webapp/MainActivity.java"

2. If necessary, replace the default app image by replacing the image files located in:
   "source\app\src\main\res/"

3. If you intend to create multiple web apps, remember to update the Gradle App-ID in the Gradle files. Using the same App-ID for multiple web apps may result in conflicts when installing them on devices simultaneously.
